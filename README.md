## Welcome

This is a starter repo for me to start learning Java, having familiarised myself with Python I felt it was time to start learning another language, and Java was an obvious successor.

The rest of this readme will be left as the default VSCode Java project as I always forget basic formatting.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
